## 1) Project Analysis — User Profile (User Persona)

**Name:** Alex Martínez  
**Role:** Junior Game Dev Recruiter / Indie Studio Co-founder  
**Age:** 28  
**Context:** Alex quickly reviews candidate portfolios during short hiring windows for internships or junior positions. They look for clarity, relevance to game dev, and evidence of learning (Godot/GDScript, version control, small shipped prototypes).

**Goals & Needs**
- Assess candidate fit in **under 2 minutes**.
- Verify **technical alignment** (Godot, GDScript, basic web).
- See **concrete outputs**: small games, UI mockups, GitHub activity.
- Understand **soft skills**: teamwork, communication, reliability.

**Frustrations**
- Overly long CVs with generic claims and no examples.
- Broken links or hidden contact info.
- Visual designs that hurt readability.

**Why this site works for Alex**
- Clear two-column layout emphasizes **contact, skills, and projects**.
- Quick access to **portfolio links** and **GitHub/Figma**.
- Concise copy, consistent hierarchy, and responsive design.

## 2) Project Analysis — Information Architecture

This project follows a **single-page structure** organized in two columns to optimize skim-reading. The **left column** contains stable, high-frequency reference content: contact information, languages, licenses, and skills. Placing these items on the left allows recruiters to verify essential facts immediately without scrolling deeply. The **skills** list highlights relevant technologies (Godot, GDScript, HTML/CSS/JS, Git/GitHub) and soft skills (teamwork, adaptability), which are frequently used as quick filters during screening.

The **right column** presents time-dependent and narrative content: name and role in a prominent header, followed by **work experience**, **personal projects**, **complementary training**, **professional objective**, and **academic background**. This order supports a top-to-bottom reading flow: first, identity and focus; second, experience and demonstrable output; third, learning initiatives; and finally, formal education. “Personal projects” appears early because it best represents technical alignment for an entry-level profile in game development. Each section uses short bullet points for fast parsing and consistent line length.

Navigation is intentionally minimal (no navbar) to avoid distraction and reduce cognitive load. Visual anchors (section titles in small caps, consistent spacing, and subtle dividers) help users locate content. Links (email, GitHub Pages, Figma) are kept visible and conventional. On mobile, the grid collapses into a single column with preserved hierarchy. Overall, the information architecture balances **speed, clarity, and recruiter priorities**, enabling a quick qualification while keeping enough depth for a confident first impression.

## 3) Project Analysis — Visual Design

The visual design prioritizes **readability, hierarchy, and professional tone**. The layout uses a **two-column grid**: a compact sidebar for immutable data and a flexible main area for narrative sections. White cards with soft borders and rounded corners separate content blocks, improving scannability and reducing visual noise. The chosen typeface, **Inter**, offers excellent x-height and legibility at small sizes, which is ideal for dense CV content and multi-device rendering.

Color is used sparingly. A **teal accent** emphasizes headings, tags, and interactive states, providing a modern feel without overwhelming the content. Neutral background and ink colors keep contrast high, meeting accessibility expectations. Spacing is carefully tuned: consistent paddings and gaps create visual rhythm, while tight section titles (small caps, increased letter spacing) act as anchors. Bullet lists avoid long paragraphs, aligning with recruiter scanning behavior.

The header features the candidate’s **name in bold weight** and a concise subtitle (“Student in Video Game Design and Development”), establishing identity and intent in the first viewport. The design avoids unconventional patterns (e.g., experimental navigation or color-heavy backgrounds) to ensure predictable reading and **printing quality**. A dedicated print stylesheet formats the page for **A4**, removes shadows, and keeps borders for structure. The result is a **clean, understated** presentation that lets content (skills, projects, and links) take center stage while communicating attention to detail—an important signal for software and game development roles.
